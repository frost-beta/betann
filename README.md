# BetaNN

This project implements computation kernels using WebGPU, with C++ APIs. It is
in very early stage and not ready for any use.

Most of the code are highly inspired by MLX's Metal kernels.

Targets:

* Power a WebGPU backend for MLX.
* Provide a library for porting machine learning frameworks to WebGPU.
* Support WebAssembly target and run in browsers.
